# CS36 AR/VR Social Studio: Final assignment

This assignment is worth 200 points (Marbles, Pokemon, your Room, and the Hubs field trip were each worth 100).  You will:

* Build an interactive VR scene, with
	* 	a scene combining prospect and refuge, with at least two lights
	*  wearables: automatically-assigned masks/hats/etc or other accessories on the user bodies
	*  a cheeseplate: an interactive object that can be manipulate by all users and serve as a conversation starter
	*  a chat pet: a non-interactive object or event that changes over time to provide a conversation starter, or sets the mood	
* Run a user test of the scene in class on Wednesday June 1 (can participate remotely if necessary), but will be much harder
* Fill out this response form with complete thoughts (ie, a couple of well-written sentences per prompt)

Notes: **Your code will automatically assign costumes for users.** This means you don't get to pick your own outfit, and can't see it! You have to ask others to describe what you are wearing to you. This can also be a conversation starter!

**Your chat pet will be controlled only by time.** We don't need to transmit data about what is happening with the chat pet, because everyone shares the same time (we all watch the same sunset, e.g) This is also how Wordle and Blaseball do "social", by having a shared universe that we all watch and talk about. What is something that would be fun to watch as a group?


Turn in to Canvas:

* **`finalproject_individualresponse_yourname.md`**
* **a screenshot of all your team members** in the scene

Groups are recommended for building your scene, but the markdown is written **individually**. No more than 5 members per team

**You will be using the Paripassu repo (to be released Thursday May 26)** You are welcome and encouraged to reuse any code from previous AFrame exercises.

### What did you make as your wearables?
The avatars have a hat that looks like the diamond or the flower. They also have cute little round arms. They have their own costums with different color and scheme of head.

### What are the refuge and prospect in your scene?
We have a strange feast on a wild asteroid near the moon where everyone can hang around in the forest or stand next to the fires and pots to chat. It gives a sense of magical fairy tale to hold a feast surrounded by trees and rocks. The cooking tool is also primary as a big pot. We could imagine ourself as the wizards and witches to have a different experience from our own character in the reality.

### What costumes/wearables are available in your scene?
The players have different color of body, arms and head scheme, The flowery head is consistent to the body color.

### Describe what your chatpet is and what it changes over time
As we stand on a asteroid, we have the moon hanging in the sky rotating through time. 
 
### Describe what your cheeseplate is and how users can interact with it
The campfire can be interacted by clicking to make it bigger. One of the pot on the fire can dodge your click by moving away from your mouse cursor and grow itself up. They also change brightness according to their size.

# Playtests

### Emails of your playtesters
huiye2023@u.northwestern.edu
andrewliso2022@u.northwestern.edu
ruiyang2022@u.northwestern.edu
yijingwei2022@u.northwestern.edu
tianyuwu2023@u.northwestern.edu

### What were some of the user reactions during your playtest?
They had fun gathering together on this weird asteroid. The interaction of the pot is awesome. They wanted us to add the chatpet sooner so they could have something to talk about.

"I like how vivid the trees and the moon are. The moon is rotating. It makes me feel like I am actually in the woods at night. The pot in the middle is definitely a conversation starter. Whenver I click it, it moves. It also makes me wonder what is in the pot. Could it be poison? Or potion? Or just soup? Overall this is a fun space to hang out with friends!"

### What did you change (or want to change) after the playtest?
We added the chatpet afterwards and modified the scene and pot and tree objects.

### Describe two other experiences you playtested (and their team names)
Team 777: The planet is cute. I can increase its size greatly. The star + planet gives an atmosphere of mystery.
Team GreenHouse: This scene is like in the wild fantasy world, with green glass in a concrete room floating above an ocean. The basketball can expand when clicking it. Thatâ€™s cute.


# Reflections


### Pick two authors/speakers that we have read in the class. Starting with "My name is _ and I care about..." (as an example), write two one-or-two-paragraph reviews of your experience, one from each of their perspectives. What did they see when looking at your project? Include one quote from each author that supports that opinion.
My name is Oldenburg and I care about the benefit of third party place outside of workplace and home. I saw the complement of real world workplace and home from this project, as it provides a fantasied environment which differs a lot from real world. The players could relax or explore inside of this third place freely and chat wtih the others about the scene, chatpet or cheeseplates. It also meets the requirement of refuge and prospect, to help players refresh and recover away from homeplace. 
Quote from Oldenburg-Brissett1982_Article_TheThirdPlace: "At the same time, participation in third places does not, in our eyes, detract from an individual's involvement at home and work. In fact, we feel it complements and supports such involvement."

My name is Alexander and I care about how to bring up friendship in the social event. I saw the successful way to help make friend between players in this project, by building the cheeseplate and chatpet inside of the scene. These objects give the chance for proximity between people. By gathering together around the fire and talking about the moon, people are being close together and will have interactions, as the first step before making friends.
Quote from Group Report: Design Practices for Human Scale Online Games: "Friendship formation requires key ingredient as proximity. Being close together to one another encourages frequent serendipitous interactions."
 
### Our goal for this class was to create a "good party" in VR. What parts of your scene felt successful in that? 
I think our scene is successful on creating the atmosphere of refuge and prospect. The magical and mystery is weird but also differ a lot from the real world, making players inside of it receive a complement of the reality and jump out of the regular character for real to observe as the third party. The fire and bright light provides enough safety as a refuge away from the earth in the universe but without being too shiny.

### What still seems to be missing? What topics did we skip in class that you think might have answered that question? 
I think it would be great if players could interact with cheeseplate by grabing and moving it with hands in reality rather than merely clicking it by mouse. In class we talked about the body-tracking but don't have a chance as the six axes are difficult to set and the suitable equipment such as quest2 controllers to implement this topic in our scene.
